GoPatterns
==========

This package is a set of Unity Editor tools and runtime classes to create GameObjects using different patterns.

You can create gameObjects in your scene using different patterns at runtime and inside Unity Editor.

1- Create based on geometrical patterns like spheres, cubes, rectangles and ...
2- Create based on tiles.
3- Create based on tile images. The library processes your image and creates the tile from it for you.
4- Using creative parameter values, you can create really nice shapes. imagine 130 random boxes insidea sphere with radius of 3

There are multiple wizards in GameObject/Placement menu and an editor window in Windows/Tile Editor menu.
At runtime there is a Placement class which you can use. 


The documentation and a sample scene are inside the project in Assets folder.
